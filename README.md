# Deep-Neural-Network-for-Clustering
Autoencoders -  a deep neural network was used for feature extraction followed by clustering of the "Cancer" dataset using k-means technique

<h1> Objective </h1>
 This project is an attempt to use “Autoencoders” which is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique for feature extraction and then  use the hidden layer activations which is given as input to the k-means algorithm for clustering.
